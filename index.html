           <p>I‚Äôm 19, from Chicago.</p>
           <p>I‚Äôm into design, business, and building things.</p>
           <p>I run <a href="http://builtbyabdul.com" class="project-link">Built by Abdul</a>, helping businesses grow with AI & automation. This is what I spend the most of my time doing.</p>
           <p>In my free time, I like to read, write, and lift. Currently teaching myself to code.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>I‚Äôve been entrepreneurial my whole life. Ever since moving to America at 10, I helped my Dad sell socks and TVs in flea markets, , ornaments in malls, and books on Amazon. I later moved to streetwear, flipping clothes on Grailed until I got banned.</p>
            <p>I started my first real company at 15. After teaching myself Photoshop, mass DMing all of my 300 followers on Instagram, and setting up a Shopify site, I launched Mir Studio. This project continued until I lost the love for it after 3 years. I made(and lost) around $25k in total.</p>
            <p>In 2024, I moved to New York to study design at Pratt, until  I dropped out a semester later. During this time, I made videos & turned Mir into <a href="http://combatny.com" class="project-link">Combat</a> with my best friend. We made products, designed a magazine, and showcased in a pop-up. Combat‚Äôs focus has changed since from a clothing brand to a community for creative individuals.</p>
            <p>Early 2025, I moved back to Chicago to ‚Äúlock in‚Äù and start making money. I took a break from all social media and cut off friends. I learned about AI & automation and started a new business, Built by Abdul. This is what I‚Äôm working on now, learning code & building random ideas on the side.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>I love making things. I grew up very creative. I dabbled in video, product design, and content creation. Took a break from these this year to start an agency and focus on making money. Now I love making money lol.</p>
            <li>My heroes growing up were Steve Jobs & Ye. These 2 inspired me to live life differently. I recommend the biography and documentary to everyone.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôm in the pursuit of physical excellence. I love the gym. Bulking until I feel my muscles are big enough, then starting martial arts.</li>
            <li>My favorite movies are Nightcrawler, The Social Network and Her.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôm searching for my other half. My ride or die. A curious, kind, fit, gorgeous, pieous, smart, funny, warm, woman with style.</li>
          </ul>

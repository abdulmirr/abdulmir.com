           <p>I’m 19, from Chicago.</p>
           <p>I’m into design, business, and building things.</p>
           <p>I run <a href="http://builtbyabdul.com" class="project-link">Built by Abdul</a>, a cold email agency helping businesses grow with AI. This is what I spend the most of my time doing.</p>
           <p>I'm studying Communication at UIUC, but I could care less about that.</p>
           <p>In my free time, I like to read, speed, and lift.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>The Great Lock In of 2026</h2>
            <p>I'm currently running a personal experiment to see how much I can accomplish in 365 days and documenting the journey in public.</p>
            <p>I'm tracking all of my habits & output on this <a href="https://www.notion.so/Output-25a89f395c1980e19368f06299daee31?source=copy_link" class="project-link">Notion page</a>, writing a weekly blog reflecting on my progress, and making videos about it on Instagram.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>I’ve been entrepreneurial my whole life. Ever since moving to America at 10, I helped my Dad sell socks and TVs in flea markets, ornaments in malls, and books on Amazon. I later moved to streetwear, flipping clothes on Grailed until I got banned.</p>
            <p>I started my first real company at 15. After teaching myself Photoshop, mass DMing all of my 300 followers on Instagram, and setting up a Shopify site, I launched Mir Studio. This project continued until I lost the love for it after 3 years. I made(and lost) around $25k in total.</p>
            <p>In 2024, I moved to New York to study design at Pratt, until  I dropped out a semester later. During this time, I made videos & turned Mir into <a href="http://combatny.com" class="project-link">Combat</a> with my best friend. We made products, designed a magazine, and showcased in a pop-up. Combat’s focus has changed since from a clothing brand to a community for creative individuals.</p>
            <p>Early 2025, I moved back home to Chicago to lock in and start making money. I took a break from all social media and cut off friends. I learned about AI & automation and started a new business, Built by Abdul. This is what I’m working on now, studying & making videos on the side.</p>
          
            <br>
            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>I love making things. I grew up very creative. I dabbled in video, product design, and content creation. Took a break from these this year to start an agency and focus on making money. Now I love making money lol.</p>
            <li>My heroes growing up were Steve Jobs & Ye. These 2 inspired me to live life differently. I recommend the biography and documentary to everyone.</li>
            <li>I’m in the pursuit of physical excellence. I love the gym. Bulking until I feel my muscles are big enough, then starting martial arts.</li>
            <li>My favorite movies are Nightcrawler, The Social Network and Her.</li>
            <li>I’m searching for my other half. My ride or die. A curious, kind, fit, gorgeous, smart, funny, warm, woman with style.</li>
          </ul>
